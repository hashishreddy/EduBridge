## No-Internet Education via SMS


## Overview
In an effort to democratize access to education and leverage the power of AI for learning, our project introduces a revolutionary approach to enable students without internet access to benefit from state-of-the-art machine learning models. Utilizing the simplicity of SMS-based communication, our application bridges the gap between advanced educational resources and unprivileged students.

## Features

- Extensive use of IDC(intel developer cloud - Small VM - Intel® Xeon 4th Gen ® Scalable processor) and the intel OneAPI - AI Analytics tool kit(Intel distribtuion for pytorch(IPEX)) for increasing efficiency and optimisation.
- *Image to Text via SMS*: Users can capture images of their educational materials, and our app will extract the text from these images.
- *SMS-Based Queries*: Once the text is extracted, it's sent as an SMS to our backend system. This enables students to ask questions based on the text extracted from their educational materials or they can directly aproach through SMS.
- *LLM Integration (Phi2)*: Queries received via SMS are processed by our LLM, Phi2, which is specifically trained to provide educational assistance and answers to a wide array of subjects.
- *SMS Responses*: The answers generated by Phi2 are sent back to the students through SMS, ensuring a seamless, efficient, and cost-effective learning experience.

## How It Works

1. *Capture and SMS*: Students capture an image of the text they need help with using our app or directly utilise the SMS option in the app.
2. *Text Extraction and Question Submission*: The app extracts text from the image and sends it as an SMS to our system, along with the student's question.
3. *Processing by Phi2*: The question is processed by our Phi2 LLM, which generates a tailored response.
4. *Receiving Answers*: The answer is sent back to the student via SMS, enabling them to learn and understand the material without needing internet access.

## Technology Stack

-                                 
- *SMS API*: For sending and receiving SMS messages, ensuring broad accessibility even in areas without internet connectivity.
- *LLM (Phi2)*: We have taken the pre-trained,finetuned large lanugage model "phi-2-orange" by "rhysjones" capable of understanding and providing answers to educational queries.
- The Phi2 model is termed as one of the best llms designed to provide educational assistance through natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition capabilities.
- A two-step finetune of Phi-2, with a bit of zest.
- First using a collection of broad training data:
    
    Open-Orca/SlimOrca-Dedup
    
    migtissera/Synthia-v1.3
    
    LDJnr/Verified-Camel
    
    LDJnr/Pure-Dove
    
    LDJnr/Capybara
    
    meta-math/MetaMathQA
    
- And then a DPO finetune using:
   
    Intel/orca_dpo_pairs
    
    argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned


- *Image Processing Technology*: For converting images captured by students into text using Google's API i.e,Text recognition v2 ML kit, making the content accessible for LLM processing.

## Getting Started

To start using this project, follow these steps:

1. *Download the App*: Check edubridge.apk file.
2. *Register*: Follow the in-app instructions to register your phone number for the SMS service.
3. *Start Learning*: Capture images of your study materials or send a message through SMS to our Phi2 model to get your desired answers.
